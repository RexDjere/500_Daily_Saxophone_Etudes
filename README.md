## Manual for Building this Book

1. The MuseScore scores are in the 01_etudes folder.
2. I built all .odt text files for the book using [LibreOffice Writer](https://libreoffice.org).
You can find the files in the 02_odt_files.
3. The GIMP files that I used in building the book are in the 03_gimp_xcf_files folder.
+ 3a. I exported each MuseScore score to .pdf using LibreOffice Writer. Then I imported
each .pdf into add_page_number.xcf at 600 dpi resolution to add the page numbers.
+ 3b. The book's cover is in cover.xcf.
4. 04_txt_files contains musescore_amazon.txt, which contains the MuseScore.com scores description field.

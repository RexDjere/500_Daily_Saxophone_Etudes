## Manual for Building this Book

1. The MuseScore scores are in the [01_etudes folder](https://github.com/RexDjere/500_Daily_Saxophone_Etudes/tree/main/01_etudes).
2. I built all .odt text files for the book using [LibreOffice Writer](https://libreoffice.org).
You can find the files in the [02_odt_files folder](https://github.com/RexDjere/500_Daily_Saxophone_Etudes/tree/main/02_odt_files).
3. The GIMP files that I used in building the book are in the [03_gimp_xcf_files folder](https://github.com/RexDjere/500_Daily_Saxophone_Etudes/tree/main/03_gimp_xcf_files).
	- 3a. I exported each MuseScore score to .pdf using MuseScore. 
	- 3b. Then I imported each .pdf into add_page_number.xcf at 600 dpi resolution to add the page numbers. 
	- 3c. I used PDF Arranger add each page to the pdf manuscript, and to order the pages in the pdf manuscript.
	- 3d. The book's cover is in cover.xcf.
	- 3e. Notes: to get Kindle Direct Publishing to accept the manuscript, I had to scale the entire manuscript down to 85% (using "Print to pdf" "scale" settings), so that all pages fit within the allowed 8.5x11 inch margins. I also converted all image to CMYK. I did these two steps using Adobe Acrobat DC since I couldn't figure out how to do them using Free Software.
4. The [04_txt_files folder](https://github.com/RexDjere/500_Daily_Saxophone_Etudes/tree/main/04_txt_files) contains musescore_amazon.txt, which contains the MuseScore.com scores description field.
